## Chapter 1 introduction

macroeconomics is basically just economics on a large large scale like covering societies and countries and like gdp inflation and employment.

so if like a law is passed affecting unemployment thats macroeconomics

but if some company thinks about raising prices for profits thats a micro issue

Ceteris paribus can be translated into "all other things being equal" or "holding other factors constant." For economic analysis, ceteris paribus means that **when considering the effect of one economic variable on another, all other factors that may affect the second variable are held constant**

Positive analysis: statements or questions based on the understanding of certain facts

Normative analysis: statements or questions based on societal beliefs on what should and shouldnt happen. Usually when a question says should its probably normative.

1. Economics is concerned with making choices with limited resources.
2. When making decisions, one must take into account tradeoffs and opportunity costs.
3. Specialization leads to gains for all.
4. People respond to incentives both good and bad.
5. Rational behavior requires thinking on the margin.
6. Markets are usually efficient, and when they aren't we have government correction.
7. Economic growth, low unemployment, are economic goals that do not always coincide.
8. Institutions and human creativity explain the wealth of nations.

**Adam Smith** 1723-1790

this guy born in kirckadely scotland was a profesorr of philosphy but turned into a poltiical economist later and in 1776 he published a book talking all about number 8.

## Chapter 2 production economic growth trade

Some basic questions any society needs to answer is:
What will they produce? goods and services?
How will they be produced?
Who will recieve these goods and services?

Typically we have 4 factors, land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurial ability.
You combine these 4 factors to make a suitable production method,  which makes those goods and serivces.

*Production Efficiency*: Goods and services are produced at their lowest price (opportunity) cost.

*Allocative Efficiency*: The mix of goods and services produced is just what society desires.

Production possibilities frontier PPF: A model that shows the combinations of 2 goods a society can produce at full employment. Left of the line is inefficient and the right is unnatainable or the graph is just wrong.
*The opportunity cost of 1000 tablets potentially would be maybe in a hypothetical 2 thousand backpacks. You could do it the other way as well.  So the price of making 2000 backpacks is 1000 tablets and vice versa. So 2 backpacks per tablet and 1 tablet per 2 backpacks.*

*So say at when we produce 12000 backpacks and 0 tablets our OC (Opportunity Cost) is NaN, but at 10000 backpacks and 3200 tablets the OC cost per 1 tablet is 2000 divided by 3200 which is 0.625, and then at 6000 backpacks and 5200 tablets the OC cost is 4000/2000 which is 2.00 and at 0 bp and 6000 tablets the OC is 6000/800 equals 7.50. So this is a quick slope downwards for whatever silly 2 item economy this is. Opportunity cost **INCREASES** as more of a product is produced.*

**PPF Production Possibilites Frontier** *The ppf allows us to answer: What quantities can be produced with the available resources? What is the opportunity cost to change the production mix? They are usually curved graphs.*

*Phylilis Wallace 1921 - 1933 was an economist created the stuff above. Worked at MIT and the CIA.*

*The PPF shifts to the right as an economy grows due to expanding resources and improving technologies. An outward shift of the PPF means economic **growth**.*

*A recession affects a nation's ppf curve, as the country will produce at a point below an unchanged ppf. A recession does not affect how many resources you have, just how you are using them. Like if mass unemployment happens, you still have people, they just aren't doing anything. The curve doesn't move, but you will just be producing inside the curve rather than optimally **ON** the curve.*

*Specialization, comparitve advantage, and trade. Specialization and trade increase production and it occurs between people and nations.*

***Absolute Advantage**: A country can produce more of a good than another country using the same amount of resources.*

***Comparative Advantage**: A country has a lower opportunity cost of producing a good than another country.*

*So basically with AA, on paper if one nation is just better, like I'm pretty sure Venezuela is better than Morocco at producing bananas. It is simply who can make more stuff.*

*To get the accurate CA you need to modify things a little bit and it is kinda annoying.
All countries can **gain** from trade if they follow their comparative advantage. When we remove trade barriers everyone benefits from it.*

*The reason the US doesn't make many bananas and just imports most of it is because Central America just has a comparative advantage on the US when it comes to this. Whatever the Central Americans have to make bananas they have it but we don't.*

*But lets say all we are given is that Central America makes 200 thousand tons of bananas every year, and the US only makes 100 thousand tons of bananas every year, clearly Central America has the absolute advantage as well.*

***Don't Confuse The Following Concepts:**
Even though one country can produce more of both goods, it can still benefit from trade.
Focus on Opportunity Costs.
Which country has a lower Opportunity Cost of producing coffee? Or producing cocoa!*

* *Should there be trade?*
* *Who should produce what?*

*Say Haiti can produce 50 coffee max and the DR can produce 100 coffee max, clearly the absolute advantage goes to the DR. Say Haiti produces 40 cocoa max, and the DR produces 50 cocoa max.*

*To decide who should produce what, compare the OC of producing one ton of coffee in each nation. The DR's OC for cocoa is 50/100 = 0.5 tons of cocoa while Haiti's is 40/50 or 0.8 tons of cocoa*

*In the DR what is the opportunity cost of producing 100 tons of coffee? It is 50 tons of cocoa. So per ton of coffee produce we sacrifice in OC half a ton of cocoa.*

*In Haiti, the OC of producing their 50 tons of coffee is 40 tons of cocoa, so per ton of coffee 0.8 tons of cocoa.*

*In our case, the Dominican Republic has the comparative advantage in producing coffee, because it loses less tons of cocoa per ton of coffee compared to Haiti.*

*Now we will compare the opportunity cost of producing one ton of cocoa. Which nation has the comparative advantage? Well the DR for every 100 tons of coffee could've made 50 tons of cocoa, for the ration of 2 tons of coffee per ton of cocoa, while Haiti's 50 tons of coffee and 40 tons of cocoa, for the ratio of 1.25 tons of coffee per ton of cocoa. So we see here the comparative advantage for the other product is just the reciprocal of the first one 100/50 to 50/100 and 40/50 to 50/40, so if we got right the first time, just get the reciprocal.*

***The Gains From Trade**:
Haiti made 16 cocoa and 30 coffee
DR made 20 cocoa and 60 coffee
Total: 36 90*

***With Specialization:**
Haiti made 40 cocoa and 0 coffee
DR made 0 cocoa and 100 coffee
Total: 40 100*

***Practical Constraints On Trade:***
- *Costs of trade, including transportation, communications, and general cost of business.*
- *Diminishing returns to specialization*
- *Governments limiting trade to help certain industries or in response to a recession.*

***Autarky:** Absolute economic independence or self-sufficiency, so can be when a country is entirely closed to all trade.*

# Chapter 3 Supply and Demand

***Market:** An institution that brings buyers and sellers together so that they can interact and transact with each other.

***Price System:** A name given to the market economy because prices provide considerable information to both buyers and sellers. Buyers consider what to buy and how much, and sellers consider what to sell and how much and what method.*

***Demand:** The maximum amount of a product that buyers are willing and able to purchase over some time period at various prices, **ceteris paribus**.*

*Demand Curve: Price goes down, more people buy*

***Law of Demand:** As Price increases, quantity and demand goes down, as price decreases, quantity and demand goes up.*

***Market Demand Curve:** A horizontal summation of all individual demand curves.*

***Horizontal Summation**: Adding the number of units of the product that will be purchased at each price by all consumers.*

***Determinants of Demand:** Nonprice factors shift the demand curve. These factors include:*
- *Tastes and preferences*
- *Income*
- *Prices of related goods-substitutes and complements*
- *Number of buyers*
- *Expectations about future prices, incomes, and product availability*

*Cool acronym: IRENT Income of buyers, Related goods/Substitutes or complements, Expectations, Number of buyers, Tastes and preferences.*

***A change in price in the market of the good you're selling will NOT shift the demand curve.***

***Tastes and Preferences**: Demand for products that are popular will increase and vice versa.*

***Changes in Income**: Normal goods; Demand increases as incomes increase. Inferior goods; Demand decreases as incomes increase.*

***Price of substitutes**: Price increase of Good A, increases demand for Good B.

***Price of complements**: Complements are typically consumed together. If the price of a good increases, one buys less of that good and the demand for its complement decreases.*

***Expectations**: A change in consumers expectations about future prices, availability, and their own income.

***Change in Demand**: A change in demand occurs when one or more of the determinants of demand changes; it shifts the entire demand curve. A change in demand is not the same as change in quantity demanded.*

*A change in demand would be the Price relative to the Quantity moving to the right or left, a change in Quantity Demanded is simply moving towards the X axis as price decreases on the Y as X increases towards quantity.*

***Supply**: The maximum amount of a product that sellers are willing and able to offer for sale over some time period at various prices, **ceteris paribus***.

*As the price increases the quantity demanded will ALWAYS decrease. - Demand*

*As the Quantity increases, the price increases. - Supply*

***Law of Supply:** Price and quantity supplied are positively related. As prices rise, providers want to sell more to maximize profit.*

***Market Supply Curve**: Horizontal summation of all individual supply curves. Example: 10 Builders build 100 houses each. Market supply equals 1,000.*

***Determinants of Supply**: Nonprice factors shift the supply curve. These factors include:*
- *Production technology*
- *Costs of resources*
- *Prices of related commodities*
- *Expectations*
- *Number of sellers*
- *Taxes and subsidies*

*Cool acronym: ITEND*
*Inputs*
*Technology*
*Expectations*
*Number of sellers*
*Disaster (usually natural(hopefully))*

***Product Technology**: Supply increases when improvements in technology lower the cost of production.*

***Cost of Resources**: Supply increases if the cost of resources (Such as labor wages or raw materials) used decreases, and vice versa.*

***Prices of related commodities**: An increase in prices of electric cars, will decrease the supply of gas cars.*

***Expectations**: Expectation of a future increase in price decreases supply now. Example: If the value of commercial real estate is expected to increase, owners hold on to their properties, decreasing supply.*

***Numbers of sellers**: As more producers enter a market, supply increases (and vice versa). Example: As more firms produce surfboards, supply increases.*

***Taxes and Subsidies**: Affect costs and therefore supply. Example: A 10% tax on imported European cars reduces the supply of such cars.*

***Effect of subsidies**: When subsidies on solar and wind expire, supply decreases.*

*A change in quantity supplied is just a point moving up on the Y (price) and the X (quantity) *

*A change in supply is an entire shift of the supply curve, same idea as the demand curve.*

***Market Equilibrium**: Occurs when quantity supplied equals quantity demanded(Quantity S = Quantity D). The equilibrium price is the price at which quantity supplied equals quantity demanded. Equilibrium quantity: The output at which Qs = Qd.

***When prices are too high:** If the price is 5 dollars, and the quantity demanded is 10 and the quantity supplied is 20, a surplus of 10 unites results. Sellers must reduce the price until the quantity demanded = the quantity supplied = 15. The equilibrium price is therefore 4 dollars. Qs > Qd -> 20 - 10 = 10.*

***When prices are too low:** At P=3 dollars, Qd=20 and Qs=10. A shortage of 10 units results. Sellers must increase the price until Qd=Qs=15. Equilibrium price = 4 dollars.*

***Demand Shifts and Market Equilibrium:** An increase in demand causes the equilibrium to move to a higher price and quantity.*

***Supply shifts and Market Equilibrium:** An increase in supply causes the equilibrium to move to a lower price and higher quantity*

***When Both Curves Shift:** If demand and supply both increase, the equilibrium quantity increases, but the equilibrium price depends on the relative magnitude of the shifts.*

***Alfred Marshall**: 1842-1924 Developed modern supply and demand analysis, was John Maynard Keynes' teacher. In 1890 published principles of economics, introducing many new ideas. Together like scissor blades that cross at equilibrium.*

# Chapter 4 Markets and Government

***Consumer Surplus:*** The difference between what consumers are willing and able to pay and the market price. WTP = Willingness to pay.

***Producer Surplus***: The difference between market price and the price at which firms are willing to supply it.

*You want to subtract the WTP minus the price you actally pay which will give you your consumer surplus.*

Individual consumer surplus: A consumer is willing to pay 11 dollars but only pays 6 dollars for something so has a surplus of 5 dollars. Another consumer has 10 and buys the same thing but has only 4 left.

***Total consumer surplus:*** The sum of all individual consumer surplus. The area below the demand curve and above the market/equilibrium price.

***Individual Producer Surplus***: The price is 6 dollars but is willing to sell for 2 dollars so only makes 4 dollars.

***Total producer surplus:*** The sum of all individual producer surplus. The area above the supply curve and below the market price.

The producer surplus is 1/2 the base times the height of the triangle given is the producer surplus.

***Market efficiency***: Markets are efficient when they generate the largest amount of net benefits to all parties involved.

***Total Surplus***: The sum of the consumer surplus and producer surplus that is maximized when markets are efficient. *TS = CS + PS*

*When the price exceeds equilibrium, so not at market equilibrium as the firm has raised the price, the quantity demanded will fall, and we endup with deadweight losses, which hurt the consumer.*

***Deadweight loss***: The reduction in total surplus that results from the inefficiency of a market that is not in equilibrium.

*When price is below equilibrium, the producer surplus transferred to consumers which hurts the producers.*

***Government intervention in markets***: Governments can make price ceilings and price floors to help mitigate effects of inefficient markets.

***Price controls***: A market that is allowed to function without any government intervention is called Laissez-Faire. However scoiety sometimes argues that market prices are too high which harms consumers or too low which harms producers. Governments sometimes establish a price ceiling or a price floor in markets. Price floors assist producers price ceilings assist consumers.

***Price ceiling:*** Max price established by government for a product or service. They usually lead to a shortage. Shortage: Qd - Qs = Shortage amount.

***Price floor***: The minimum price established by government for a product or service. This leads to surpluses. Qs - Qd = Surplus.

***Markets are usually, but not always, efficient** , market failure occurs when the free market does not result in a socially optimal quantity of goods and services.*

***Sources of market failure***
- Lack of competition
- Mismatch of information
- Existence of externalities (external benefits or costs)
- Existence of public goods

***Lack of competition***: When a market lacks competition, a firm can raise prices without worrying that other firms will undercut its price. A monopoly.

***Asymmetric information:*** Occurs when one party to a transaction has better information than another party, such as when purchasing a used car or an expensive art piece.

***External Benefit:*** Occurs when an action has a positive effect on a third party (such as planting trees)

***External cost:*** Occurs when an action adds a cost to a third party (such as driving, which creates pollution and traffic congestion)

***Public Goods:*** Non exclusive: Once a public good is provided, no one can be excluded from consuming it. Nonrival: One person consumption does not diminish benefits to others.

***Climate Change:*** Is a market failure because it exhibits characteristics of public goods. Actions taken to combat climate change are costly, but the benefits are enjoyed by everyone.

***Health Care:*** Is a service that is difficult to provide to everyone, especially when some people choose not to buy it.

***Education:*** Offers external benefits by making society more productive. But increasing educational opportunities requires subsidies that are funded by tax revenues. 

***Amartya Sen (1933-present)

- Born in india to scholarly parents
- devoted his career to addressing the causes of poverty, especially the lack of educational opportunities among the poor.
- Won the nobel prize in economic sciences in 1998, the first indian economist to win.

# Chapter 5
Business cycles are the alternating increases and decreases in economic activity.
- they vary in intensity and duration.
- Generally they show a long term upward trend.
- The four phases include peak, recession, trough, and recovery.
They kinda look like a roller coaster.

![[Pasted image 20230913193510.png]]

Dating business cycles
- the NBER (National Bureau of economic research) officially dates the U.S. business cycle.
- It looks for turning points, at which the economy switches from peak to downturn or from trough to recovery.
- turning points are established by a consensus of eminent economists after private deliberations.

**A recession is typically declared after two consecutive quarters of negative gdp growth.**

**A double dip recession occurs when a recovering economy does not reach its former peak.**
![[Pasted image 20230913195648.png]]

**Predicting recessions**

- National index activity: A weighted average of 85 indicators of economic activity. A recession is likely if the index falls below -0.70
- Leading economy index: Measures 10 important leading indicators. A recession is likely if the index decreases three months in a row.

**Yield curve**

- Shows the interest rate for bonds (y axis) with different maturity rates (x axis)
Yield is basically interest. Maturity is time.

![[Pasted image 20230913203357.png]]

**National income accounting**

The national income and product accounts (NIPA):

- Measure our nation's economic performance.
- Compare U.S. income and output to those of other nations
- Track level of economic activity throughout business cycle.
The core of the NIPA:
The size of an economy can be measured in two basic ways.
- By adding up all spending or
- By adding up all income earned

# Chapter 6 Part 1
Inflation is a general rise in prices of goods and services.

Although prices have risen significantly over time, wages rose even faster for most workers.

**What causes inflation?**

- Demand factors: consumer confidence, income, wealth
- Supply shocks: Increases in the price of inputs such as oil, resources, and farm crops.
- Government policy: Borrowing and printing money.

Too much money, but too few goods to spend it on.
